I'm an R Markdown document! 

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
litters_data = read_csv(file = "./FAS_litters.csv")
#I (almost always) use janitor::clean_names() to clean up variable names after importing data. Doing so will take whatever the column names are and convert them to lower snake case.
names(litters_data)
litters_data = janitor::clean_names(litters_data)
names(litters_data)
#The package::function syntax lets you use a function from a package without loading the whole library. Thatâ€™s really helpful, because some packages have functions with the same name (e.g. dplyr::filter and stats::filter), and R has to choose which one you mean. In general, only load the packages you need to prevent this kind of confusion. You can even use the conflicted package if you want to force yourself into using good habits!
pups_data = read_csv("./FAS_pups.csv")
pups_data
pups_data = janitor::clean_names(pups_data)
names(pups_data)

```



```{r}
#library(tidyverse)
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
#getwd()
#"./FAS_litters.csv"
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.
